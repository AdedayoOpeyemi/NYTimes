                  <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                     with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                      equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
                     have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                      bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                       infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the
                       universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
                     pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                      the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                       detection, like spit in the ocean.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                  </p>

            </div>
              <div class="article-text-row-2">

                  <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                    of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                  <p>
                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at
                    the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                    Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature
                    of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
                    of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                    colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
                    including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
                    It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
                    14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only
                    an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                    Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
                    universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
                    the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be
                    the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
                    should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
                  “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                  sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and
                as hot as the surface of the sun.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
                Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
                the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical
                Journal.
              </p>
              <div class="infographics">

              </div>
              
              <p>
                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
              </p>

              <p>
                “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
              </p>

              <p>
                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of 
                a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at 
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
              </p>

              <p>
                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as
                 he tended his radio telescopes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
                 in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
                  knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

              <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
              </p>

              <p>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, 
                but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
              </p>

              <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best 
                way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
              </p>

              <p>
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with
                 a mixture of jubilation and caution.
              </p>

              <p>
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
                 in the history of science.”
              </p>

              <p>
                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself
                 deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
              </p>

              <p>
                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that 
                if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based 
                on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
              </p>

              <p>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
              </p>

              <p>
                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                 measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
              </p>

                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
                 at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.

              </p>

              <p>
                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
                 sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University 
                 of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
              </p>

              <p>
                “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994.
                 “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
